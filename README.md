Markdown Wysiwyg is a syntax close to MarkDown with two main differences :
- when you hide syntax tokens (when leaving editingmode), appearnace doesn't change, especially, no vertical jig.
- when you add on opening token, you see immediately the effect (wwhen it's possible) before you add the closing token.

## Syntax
- '- ', '-- ', '--- '... (one or more dashes followed by a space) starts an enumeration, the number of dash is the level.
